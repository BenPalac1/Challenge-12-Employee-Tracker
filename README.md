# My-Team-Tracker
SQL Challenge: Employee-Tracker
Challenge-12
<br>
<br>

## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). 
For this module, my assignment was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## User Story

AS A business owner

I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company

SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
<br>
<br>

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I start the application

THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, 
add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role

WHEN I choose to view all departments

THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

WHEN I choose to view all roles

THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

WHEN I choose to view all employees

THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, 
departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to

WHEN I choose to add a department

THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add a role

THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

WHEN I choose to add an employee

THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
